# 🎯 TEAM MODE FIX - All 7 Agents Now Respond

## ✅ **FIXED: Team Mode Now Includes All Agents**

### **Problem:**
When you said **"Hi Everyone"** or **"Hi team"**, you only got **3 responses** (sometimes 5).

### **Root Cause:**
The backend API was only calling **5 agents** in team mode:
```python
# ❌ BEFORE (Line 100 in deploy/api/chat.py)
if "team" in message_lower or "everyone" in message_lower:
    responding_agents = ["messi", "ronaldo", "neymar", "mbappe", "benzema"]
    # Missing: Modric and Ramos!
```

### **Solution:**
Updated to include **all 7 agents**:
```python
# ✅ AFTER (Fixed)
if "team" in message_lower or "everyone" in message_lower:
    responding_agents = ["messi", "ronaldo", "neymar", "mbappe", "benzema", "modric", "ramos"]
    # Now includes everyone!
```
