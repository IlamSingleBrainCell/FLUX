# 🎯 SINGLE AGENT MODE - QUICK FIX SUMMARY

## ✅ **FIXED!**

### **The Problem:**
When you selected **"Single Agent"** mode (e.g., Modric), multiple agents were responding instead of just the one you selected.

### **The Cause:**
The Humanoid Protocol v2.0 responses include team coordination like:
```
@Ronaldo - Design architecture
@Neymar - Implement features
```

The backend was detecting these `@mentions` and adding those agents to the conversation **even in Single Agent mode**.

### **The Fix:**
**One line change in `deploy/api/chat.py` line 1852:**

```python
# BEFORE (BUG):
if mentioned_agents:

# AFTER (FIXED):
if mentioned_agents and chat_mode == 'team':
```

Now mentioned agents are **only** added when you're in **Team Mode**.

## 🎬 **HOW IT WORKS NOW:**

### **Single Agent Mode** ✅
```
YOU SELECT: Modric
YOU TYPE: "Hi, coordinate the team"

MODRIC RESPONDS:
"🎯 PROJECT COORDINATION INITIATED
@Messi - Requirements
@Ronaldo - Architecture
@Neymar - Development"

RESULT: Only Modric's message shows up
OTHER AGENTS: Do NOT respond (even though mentioned)
```

### **Team Mode** ✅
```
YOU SELECT: Team Mode
YOU TYPE: "Build login system"

MESSI RESPONDS:
"Requirements gathered. @Mbappé test this"

RONALDO RESPONDS:
"Architecture designed"

NEYMAR RESPONDS:
"Code implemented"

MBAPPÉ RESPONDS (Round 2):
"Test cases created" (joined because Messi mentioned him)

RESULT: Multiple agents collaborate dynamically
```
