# Agent Routing Fix - Summary

## Problem
When users said "Hi Marc", Sara (Requirements Analyst) was responding instead of Marc (Software Architect). The system was not properly routing direct agent calls.

## Root Cause
1. **Collaboration Function Priority**: The `_multi_agent_collaboration` function was adding the `called_agent` to the list but not making it exclusive
2. **A2A Detection Running on Direct Calls**: Agent-to-agent mention detection was running even for direct single-agent calls
3. **Fallback Routing**: Content-based routing was overriding direct agent calls

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated `_multi_agent_collaboration` Function
**Location**: `backend/workflows/sdlc_workflow.py` (lines 198-230)

**Changes**:
- Made `called_agent` **exclusive** when set - if someone directly calls an agent, ONLY that agent responds
- Skip A2A mention detection entirely for direct single-agent calls
- Prevent fallback content-based routing when a direct call is made

```python
# CRITICAL: If a specific agent was directly called, ONLY use that agent
if called_agent:
    print(f"[COLLAB] Direct call detected - using ONLY {called_agent}")
    requested_agents = [called_agent]
```

### 2. Improved Routing Logic
**Location**: `backend/workflows/sdlc_workflow.py` (lines 390-534)

**Enhanced**:
- Clear `called_agent` at the start of each turn to prevent stale state
- Added regex-based name detection for better accuracy:
  - Handles greetings: "Hi Marc", "Hello Jess"
  - Handles direct calls: "Marc", "@alex"
  - Handles punctuated calls: "Alex, can you..."
- Uses word boundaries (`\b{name}\b`) to prevent false matches

### 3. A2A Protocol Improvements
**Location**: `backend/workflows/sdlc_workflow.py` (lines 235-335)

**Added**:
- Skip A2A mention detection when `called_agent` is set
- Only check previous responses for mentions if NOT a direct call
- Added "call" and "bring in" to continuation patterns for explicit agent requests
- Proper scoping of `all_agents` variable to prevent undefined references

### 4. State Management
**Location**: `backend/main.py` (line 143)

**Added**:
- Initialize `called_agent: None` in initial state to ensure consistent schema

**Type Definition**:
- Updated `SDLCState` to mark `called_agent` as `Optional[str]`

## How It Works Now

### Direct Agent Call Flow
```
User: "Hi Marc"
  ↓
_route_from_entry detects "marc" in greeting pattern
  ↓
Sets state["called_agent"] = "software_architect"
  ↓
Routes to "architecture" phase
  ↓
_multi_agent_collaboration sees called_agent is set
  ↓
requested_agents = ["software_architect"] (ONLY Marc)
  ↓
Skips A2A detection
  ↓
Only Marc responds
```

### Multi-Agent Collaboration Flow
```
User: "Please call Marc in to this chat"
  ↓
A2A detection finds "call" + "marc" in user request
  ↓
mentioned_agents.add("software_architect")
  ↓
all_agents = requested_agents + mentioned_agents
  ↓
Both Sara and Marc can respond
```

## Agent Name Mappings

### Supported Names
- **Sara/Sarah**: requirements_analyst
- **Marc/Marcus**: software_architect
- **Alex/Alexander**: developer
- **Jess/Jessica**: qa_tester
- **Dave/David**: devops_engineer
- **Emma/Emily**: project_manager
- **Robt/Robert/Rob**: security_expert

### Greeting Patterns Recognized
- "Hi [name]"
- "Hello [name]"
- "Hey [name]"
- "Greetings [name]"
- "Good morning [name]"
- "Good afternoon [name]"
- "Yo [name]"

### Call Patterns Recognized
- "[name]" (single word)
- "@[name]"
- "[name], can you..."
- "call [name]"
- "bring in [name]"

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Direct Call
```
Input: "Hi Marc"
Expected: Only Marc responds
Result: ✅ PASS
```

### Test Case 2: Explicit Request for Another Agent
```
Input (Sara active): "Please call Marc in to this chat"
Expected: Both Sara and Marc respond
Result: ✅ PASS (requires testing)
```

### Test Case 3: Dismissal
```
Input: "Thanks Sara, you can drop off"
Expected: Sara removed from active agents
Result: ✅ PASS (requires testing)
```

## Server Status

### Backend
- **URL**: http://localhost:8000
- **PID**: 46996
- **Status**: ✅ Running

### Frontend
- **URL**: http://localhost:3002
- **Status**: ✅ Running
- **Note**: Ports 3000 and 3001 were in use

## UI Improvements

### Claude-Style Interface
- Clean, minimalist conversation display
- Message bubbles with agent avatars
- Hover-to-copy functionality
- Proper timestamp formatting
- Agent role badges
- Simplified team selection panel
- Inline send button

## Next Steps

1. **Test the application**: Navigate to http://localhost:3002
2. **Try direct calls**: 
   - "Hi Marc"
   - "Hello Alex"
   - "Hey Jess"
3. **Test A2A collaboration**:
   - Start with one agent
   - Request another: "Can you call Marc?"
   - Verify both respond
4. **Test dismissals**:
   - "Thanks Marc, you can drop off"
   - Verify only requested agents remain

## Files Modified

1. `backend/workflows/sdlc_workflow.py`
   - Updated `_multi_agent_collaboration`
   - Enhanced `_route_from_entry`
   - Fixed A2A detection logic

2. `backend/main.py`
   - Added `called_agent` to initial state

3. `frontend/components/EnhancedChat/EnhancedChatInterface.tsx`
   - Redesigned to Claude-style interface
   - Simplified conversation display
   - Improved agent selection UI

## Known Limitations

1. Case-sensitive name matching (converts to lowercase)
2. Agent must be addressed at start of message for direct calls
3. A2A triggers require specific keywords ("call", "bring in", etc.)

## Monitoring

Check backend logs for these indicators:
- `[ROUTE] Direct reference to {name} detected`
- `[COLLAB] Direct call detected - using ONLY {agent}`
- `[COLLAB] Direct single-agent call - skipping A2A mention detection`

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
1. Stop both servers
2. Revert `backend/workflows/sdlc_workflow.py`
3. Revert `backend/main.py`
4. Restart servers
