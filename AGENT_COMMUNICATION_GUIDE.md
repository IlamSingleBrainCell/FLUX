## 💬 How to Call Agents

### 1. **Direct Agent Call** (Recommended for single agent)

Simply greet the agent by name:

```
Hi Messi
Hello Ronaldo
Hey Neymar
```

**Result:** Only that specific agent will respond with a personalized answer generated by Groq AI.

---

### 2. **Keyword-Based Routing** (Automatic)

The system automatically routes to the best agent based on keywords:

```
"I need help with requirements"  → Messi responds
"Design a microservices architecture"  → Ronaldo responds
"Write code for authentication"  → Neymar responds
"Create test cases"  → Mbappé responds
"Deploy to production"  → Benzema responds
```

---

### 3. **Multi-Agent Collaboration** (Team Mode)

Call multiple agents at once:

```
"Hi everyone, let's discuss the new feature"
"Hello team, I need help with this project"
"Hey all, what are your thoughts on this?"
```

**Result:** All 5 agents respond with their perspectives, powered by Groq AI.

---

### 4. **Agent-to-Agent Communication** (A2A)

Agents can call each other automatically. For example:

```
User: "Hi Messi, gather requirements for a payment system"
Messi: "... Here are the requirements. Ronaldo, can you design the architecture?"
Ronaldo: "... Here's the architecture design. Neymar, please implement this."
Neymar: "... Code is ready. Mbappé, please test it."
```

**Automatic Flow:** When one agent mentions another by name, that agent automatically joins the conversation.

---

## 🚀 Real-Time Response Flow

### What Happens When You Send a Message:

1. **WebSocket Connection** establishes with backend (`ws://localhost:8000/ws/{session}`)
2. **Message is routed** to the appropriate agent(s)
3. **Agent processes request** using Groq AI (LLaMA 3.3 70B / GPT-OSS-120B models)
4. **Response streams back** via WebSocket in real-time
5. **Frontend displays** agent response with avatar, name, and timestamp

---

## 🔧 Backend Architecture

### WebSocket Flow:
```
Frontend (Next.js)
    ↓ WebSocket (port 3002 → 8000)
Backend FastAPI (main.py)
    ↓ Routes to
SDLC Workflow (LangGraph)
    ↓ Calls
Agent (e.g., Messi, Ronaldo, Neymar)
    ↓ Generates response using
Groq AI (groq_models.py)
    ↓ Streams back
Frontend displays response
```

### Agent System Prompts:

Each agent has a unique personality and expertise:

- **Messi:** "You are Messi ⚽, a Senior Requirements Analyst with 8+ years of experience..."
- **Ronaldo:** "You are Ronaldo ⚽, a Senior Software Architect specializing in scalable systems..."
- **Neymar:** "You are Neymar ⚽, a Senior Full-Stack Developer with expertise in modern frameworks..."
- **Mbappé:** "You are Mbappé ⚽, a Senior QA Engineer focused on quality and testing..."
- **Benzema:** "You are Benzema ⚽, a Senior DevOps Engineer with cloud infrastructure expertise..."

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Agents Not Responding

**Symptoms:** You see "Typing..." but no response appears

**Solutions:**
1. **Check backend is running:**
   ```bash
   cd c:\YOKA\FLUX\backend
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Verify Groq API key is set:**
   ```bash
   # Check .env file
   cat .env | grep GROQ_API_KEY
   ```

3. **Check WebSocket connection:**
   - Open browser DevTools → Network tab → WS filter
   - Should see connection to `ws://localhost:8000/ws/{session}`

---

### Issue 2: Generic/Mock Responses

**Symptoms:** Agents say "Hello! I'm ready to help" instead of real answers

**Cause:** Frontend showing cached/sample data instead of backend responses

**Solution:** 
1. Clear browser cache and reload
2. Restart backend server
3. Check browser console for WebSocket errors

---

### Issue 3: Agent Names Wrong

**Symptoms:** Seeing "Sara", "Marc", "Alex" instead of "Messi", "Ronaldo", "Neymar"

**Solution:** Backend agents have been updated - restart backend:
```bash
cd c:\YOKA\FLUX\backend
python main.py
```

## 📝 Example Conversations

### Example 1: Single Agent (Direct Call)
```
User: Hi Messi, I need requirements for a blog platform

Messi ⚽: Hello! I'm Messi, your Requirements Analyst. Let me help you gather
requirements for your blog platform. Based on standard blog functionality,
here are the key requirements:

**Functional Requirements:**
1. User Management
   - User registration and authentication
   - User profiles with bio and avatar
   - Role-based access control (Admin, Editor, Viewer)

2. Content Management
   - Create, edit, and delete blog posts
   - Rich text editor with formatting
   - Image and media uploads
   - Draft and publish workflow
   - Categories and tags

... [Real Groq AI-generated response continues]
```

---

### Example 2: Multi-Agent Collaboration
```
User: Hi team, help me build a payment gateway

Messi ⚽: From a requirements perspective, here are the core needs:
- Secure payment processing (PCI-DSS compliance)
- Support for multiple payment methods (credit cards, PayPal, Stripe)
- Transaction history and receipts
- Refund management
... [Continues]

Ronaldo ⚽: For the architecture, I recommend:
- Microservices architecture for scalability
- API Gateway pattern for security
- Event-driven design for asynchronous processing
- Database: PostgreSQL for transactions, Redis for caching
... [Continues]

Neymar ⚽: I can implement this using:
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Payment SDK: Stripe API
- Database ORM: Prisma
- Code structure: Clean architecture with repositories
... [Continues]

Mbappé ⚽: For testing, I'll create:
- Unit tests for payment logic (Jest)
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for payment flows (Cypress)
- Security testing for PCI compliance
... [Continues]

Benzema ⚽: For deployment, I'll set up:
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Docker containers for consistency
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- AWS/Azure for cloud hosting
... [Continues]
```

---

### Example 3: Agent-to-Agent Communication
```
User: Hi Messi, create user stories for authentication

Messi ⚽: Here are the user stories:

**User Story 1:** As a new user, I want to register an account...
**User Story 2:** As a registered user, I want to login securely...
**User Story 3:** As a user, I want to reset my password...

Ronaldo, can you design the authentication architecture for these requirements?

[System automatically adds Ronaldo to conversation]

Ronaldo ⚽: Based on Messi's requirements, here's the authentication architecture:

**Architecture Components:**
1. Authentication Service (Node.js + JWT)
2. User Database (PostgreSQL)
3. Session Management (Redis)
4. Password Hashing (bcrypt)
... [Continues]

Neymar, please implement this authentication system.

[System automatically adds Neymar to conversation]

Neymar ⚽: I'll implement the authentication system:

```javascript
// User Registration Endpoint
app.post('/api/auth/register', async (req, res) => {
  const { email, password } = req.body;
  
  // Hash password
  const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);
  
  // Save user
  const user = await db.users.create({
    email,
    password: hashedPassword
  });
  
  // Generate JWT
  const token = jwt.sign({ userId: user.id }, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
  
  res.json({ token, user });
});
```

... [Continues]
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. **Use Direct Calls for Single Tasks**
- ✅ "Hi Neymar, write code for..."
- ❌ "Everyone, help me write code"  (unnecessary - only Neymar needed)

### 2. **Use Team Mode for Complex Features**
- ✅ "Hi team, design a complete e-commerce system"
- ✅ "Everyone, review this architecture"

### 3. **Let Agents Call Each Other Naturally**
- Agents will automatically mention each other when needed
- System automatically adds mentioned agents to conversation

### 4. **Be Specific in Your Requests**
- ✅ "Messi, create user stories for authentication with OAuth2"
- ❌ "Messi, help"  (too vague)

---

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

- **API Keys:** Groq API key stored securely in `.env` file
- **Data:** Conversation history stored temporarily in session
- **WebSocket:** Real-time secure communication
- **No Storage:** Agent responses not permanently stored (ephemeral)

---

## 📞 Support

If agents are not responding with real AI-generated content:

1. **Check Backend Logs:** Look for `[GROQ]` prefixed messages
2. **Verify API Key:** `echo $GROQ_API_KEY` (should not be empty)
3. **Test Groq Connection:** Run `backend/test_single_agent_calls.py`
4. **Check Network:** Ensure WebSocket connection established
