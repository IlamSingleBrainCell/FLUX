# 🚀 FLUX CrewAI Integration - Installation & Setup Guide

## 🎯 What You're Getting

This integration adds **real autonomous agent orchestration** to FLUX while keeping your beautiful UI:

### Before (Simple):
- ❌ Keyword-based routing ("if 'messi' in message...")
- ❌ Parallel responses (no coordination)
- ❌ Simulated orchestration (UI only)
- ❌ No real tools or actions

### After (CrewAI-Powered):
- ✅ **Intelligent task routing** (AI decides which agents)
- ✅ **True agent collaboration** (agents coordinate with each other)
- ✅ **Hierarchical orchestration** (Project Manager coordinates team)
- ✅ **Real tools** (code analysis, file structure, estimation)
- ✅ **Autonomous delegation** (agents can call other agents)

## 📦 Installation Steps

### 1. Install CrewAI Dependencies

```bash
cd backend

# Install new dependencies
pip install -r requirements_crewai.txt
```

**What gets installed:**
- `crewai` - Main framework for autonomous agents
- `crewai-tools` - Built-in tools for agents
- `langchain-groq` - Groq LLM integration for CrewAI
- `duckduckgo-search` - Web search capability
- Additional tool dependencies

### 2. Verify Installation

```bash
python -c "from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew; print('✅ CrewAI installed successfully')"
```

Expected output: `✅ CrewAI installed successfully`

### 3. Start the New Backend

```bash
# Stop old backend if running
# Ctrl+C in old terminal

# Start CrewAI-powered backend
python main_crewai.py
```

Expected output:
```

### 4. Frontend (No Changes Needed!)

Your frontend works exactly the same - just enjoy the upgraded intelligence:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## 🎮 Testing the New System

### Test 1: Direct Agent Call
**Try:** "Hi Messi, analyze requirements for a chat app"

**What happens:**
- CrewAI creates task for Messi
- Messi uses `estimate_tasks` tool
- Returns detailed analysis with story points

### Test 2: Team Collaboration
**Try:** "Hey everyone, design a secure authentication system"

**What happens:**
- Modric (Project Manager) coordinates the team
- Agents work in hierarchical process
- Messi → Requirements
- Ronaldo → Architecture (uses `create_file_structure` tool)
- Neymar → Implementation plan
- Ramos → Security review (uses `analyze_code` tool)
- All responses coordinated by Modric

### Test 3: Smart Routing
**Try:** "How do I implement OAuth2 in Python?"

**What happens:**
- CrewAI analyzes the request
- Modric determines best agents: Neymar + Ramos
- Neymar provides implementation
- Ramos adds security considerations
- No need to specify agents!

---

## 🔧 Architecture Comparison

### Old System (simple_agent_router.py):
```python
# Keyword matching
if "messi" in message.lower():
    return call_messi()

# Parallel execution (no coordination)
responses = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
```

### New System (crewai_agents.py):
```python
# Intelligent routing
crew = Crew(
    agents=[messi, ronaldo, neymar],
    tasks=[requirements_task, architecture_task, dev_task],
    process=Process.hierarchical,  # ← Real orchestration
    manager_llm=groq_llm  # ← AI coordination
)

result = crew.kickoff()  # ← Agents coordinate autonomously
```

---

## 🛠️ Agent Tools & Capabilities

Each agent now has **real tools**:

### Messi (Requirements Analyst)
- ✅ `estimate_tasks` - Analyzes complexity and estimates story points
- Can delegate to Ronaldo for architecture input

### Ronaldo (Software Architect)
- ✅ `create_file_structure` - Generates project structure
- Can delegate to Neymar for implementation details

### Neymar (Developer)
- ✅ `analyze_code` - Reviews code quality and issues
- Can delegate to Mbappé for testing needs

### Mbappé (QA Tester)
- ✅ `analyze_code` - Checks test coverage and quality
- Can delegate to Ramos for security testing

### Benzema (DevOps)
- ✅ `create_file_structure` - Creates infrastructure files
- Can delegate to Ramos for security configs

### Modric (Project Manager)
- ✅ `estimate_tasks` - Project planning and estimation
- **Coordinates all other agents** in hierarchical mode

### Ramos (Security Expert)
- ✅ `analyze_code` - Security vulnerability analysis
- Can delegate to Neymar for fixes

## 📊 Performance Impact

### Response Times:
- **Simple queries:** ~Same (2-3 seconds)
- **Complex queries:** Longer but MUCH smarter (5-10 seconds)
- **Team collaboration:** More intelligent coordination

### API Usage:
- More Groq API calls (agents coordinate)
- But results are significantly better
- Consider upgrading Groq plan for heavy use

---

## 🔄 Migration Path

You have **3 options**:

### Option A: Full Switch (Recommended)
```bash
# Use main_crewai.py exclusively
python main_crewai.py
```
- Maximum intelligence
- Real orchestration
- Best long-term choice

### Option B: A/B Testing
```bash
# Run both servers on different ports
python main_minimal.py  # Port 8000 (old)
python main_crewai.py --port 8001  # Port 8001 (new)
```
- Compare responses side-by-side
- Gradual migration
- Safe rollback option

### Option C: Hybrid (Advanced)
```python
# In main_minimal.py, add:
from agents.crewai_agents import get_crewai_system

# Use simple routing for basic queries
# Use CrewAI for complex "team" requests
if detect_team_call(message):
    use_crewai()
else:
    use_simple_routing()
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "crewai not found"
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install crewai==0.70.1
```

### Issue: "langchain_groq error"
```bash
pip install langchain-groq==0.2.0
```

### Issue: "Groq API quota exceeded"
- CrewAI uses more API calls
- Upgrade your Groq plan
- Or add rate limiting:
```python
# In crewai_agents.py
llm = ChatGroq(
    api_key=api_key,
    model="llama-3.1-8b-instant",  # ← Smaller model
    max_retries=2
)
```

### Issue: Agents too verbose
```python
# In crewai_agents.py, set:
agent = Agent(
    ...,
    verbose=False  # ← Reduce logging
)
```

---

## 📈 Next Steps

### 1. Add More Tools
```python
# In crewai_agents.py, add:

@tool("web_search")
def web_search(query: str) -> str:
    """Search the web for information"""
    # Implement with DuckDuckGo
    return results

# Give to agents:
self.neymar = Agent(
    tools=[analyze_code, web_search],  # ← Add tool
    ...
)
```

### 2. Custom Workflows
```python
# Create specialized crews for specific tasks
def create_security_audit_crew():
    return Crew(
        agents=[ramos, neymar, mbappe],
        tasks=[audit_task, fix_task, test_task],
        process=Process.sequential
    )
```

### 3. Long-term Memory
```python
# Add memory to agents (CrewAI feature)
from crewai import Agent

agent = Agent(
    ...,
    memory=True,  # ← Remember past interactions
    verbose=True
)
```
